# Smaller /  Learning Projects
This repository holds my smaller projects. They are mainly for me to learn new APIs or languages. They tend to be focused on a concise solution to a a challenge that picqued my interest. 

# Card Price
This is a script used to get price info and display it to the terminal. First the program parses website data with BeautifulSoup. Then it parses this once again with string manipulation to get individual prices. Finally, pretty table is used to print info to the command line. This program supports printing of different data sets depending on user input
### Context
This was created as a personal project to get used to using Python and data science libraries.
The requirements to use this script are Python3, Requests, BeautifulSoup, and PrettyTable
