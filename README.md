# Smaller Projects for Independent Learning and Exploration
This repository holds my smaller projects. They are mainly for me to learn new APIs or languages. They tend to be focused on a concise solution to a a challenge that was of personal interest. 

# Card Price
This is a program used to get price info and display it to the terminal. First the program parses website data with BeautifulSoup. Then it parses this once again with string manipulation to get individual prices. Finally, pretty table is used to print info to the command line. This program supports printing of different data sets depending on user input

# Minigrep
This is a simple cli based text search program written in Rust. This was made by following the official Rust book here [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). This was made as a way to implement the skills I learned while following the textbook.
